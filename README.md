# Bibtex Merge

For a project I am working on I was lifting and rewriting some sections of my thesis. I needed an easy way to pull appropriate bibtex entries from the master thesis bibtex file and merge them with the file I already had started for the new project.

This is just a hacky script that I may or may not clean up in the future. But it has served my purposes so far in this project and saved me a lot of tedious labour.

# Requirements
- Python3
- bibtexparser
